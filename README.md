Hi there! I'm Lucilene DeWeese, but you can call me Lucy. Originally from Brazil, I've called Atlanta, Georgia, home for quite some time now. My time zone is Eastern Standard Time (EST), and I'm mostly available in the mornings while my kids are at school and the house is quiet. 
I have been married to Benjamin for 16 years, and together, we cherish the joys of raising two boys and a little girl. While I'm primarily a stay-at-home mom, I'm also studying Web Design and Development. I enjoy unleashing my creativity and making designs visually appealing.
In my free moments, I love getting creative with photography and crafts.  I'm a big fan of family road trips. And whenever possible, I attend concerts of my favorite band, Hanson. 
Now, as a student at BUY-I, I'm thrilled to merge my faith with my studies, finding comfort in prayer during challenges. I am excited to dive into this course, recognizing it as a fantastic opportunity to enhance my skills as a web designer. I am looking forward to the transformative learning experience ahead.
